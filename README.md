## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Was able to learn and practice overlaying images and how to center the overlay. I learned how to put focus state on an image by using the tabindex attribute...

```html
<a href="#" target="_blank"><img class="equilibrium" src="./images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="clear square glass prism balancing on one corner" tabindex="0"></a>
```
I also wanted to use this project to practice using CSS grid. I found grid much easier for this type of layout as opposed to using flexbox. However, I did use flexbox for div class=price-time.

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing overlaying images.
